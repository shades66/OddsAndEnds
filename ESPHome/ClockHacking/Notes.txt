Notes taken during investigation of how everything links together



Outputs not used on shift registers
-----------------------------------

4,5,6,10,24,30,31,32,33,34,48,63,67,68,80    (15)

possible some connect to Empty LED positions?


Total LED's populated on the shift registers (shift register position on image, driven lowest bit first,  1=ON  0=OFF)
 digits   58   (8 * 7 segments) + 2
 others  9  (pm,DST, M , D , AL1 , AL2 , % , C, F)
 days 14
total 81 LEDs

+ 2 LEDs for : between HH & MM,  driven direct by CPU

Empty LED positions
------------------

D117
D118

Buttons are a potential divider connected as follows
----------------------------------------------------

GND --- 47k resistor (R11) ---- CPUconnection ---- Buttons 1-4 --- Resistor 1-4 (R7,R9,R10,R8) --- VCC

Resistor & buttons
AL-AGM  47k  (473)  R7    approx. 2.5v at CPU Connection
PLUS    100k (104)  R9    approx. 1.59v at CPU Connection
MINUS   330K (334)  R10   approx. 0.62v at CPU Connection
SET     2.2K (222)  R8    approx. 4.7v at CPU Connection

changed R8 to 68k resistor which should make the set button return 2v at CPU Connection (not tested)

no buttons pressed R11 pulls CPU Connection to GND.


Shift Registers
---------------

TC5020  16 bit shift register.   See image & PDF for more.

CPU outputs data through each chip  CPU -> A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F
clock/LE pins connect direct to each chip
VCC appears to be connected before D33 chip?

Resistor connected to REXT  3.3k
OE/  pin appears to be tied to ground

Temperature/Humidity
--------------------

I2C device

Not tested/used but appears to be a AHT30 device.

note pullups to 5v via R12/R13 - possible to remove & use ESP pullup?

Buzzer
------

Driven via Q1.  appears to need PWM,   just clicks when driven by ESP as digital IO


CPU pins
--------

1  PowerDetect - Looks to be used to detect when the power is connected to the DC jack
2  SDO  -  Shift register Data Out
3  Buttons  - analog value    AL = 2.5v  + = 1.599v  - = .623v  SET = 4.766k
                  for 3v3 use changing the 222 resistor from 2.2k to 68k will give a reading around 2v
4  IR - Not fitted but connects to O pin where an IR sensor can be fitted
5  RTC Crystal - standard clock crystal connection
6  RTC Crystal - standard clock crystal connection
7  GND
8  I2C pin.   TBC if data/clock  . R13 is pullup to 5v.  removed and using ESP pullup
9  VCC
10 I2C pin.   TBC if data/clock  . R12 is pullup to 5v.  removed and using ESP pullup

11 Reset?  Held high by R27.
12 DOTS.   The 2 LED's in the middle of the clock.   can be PWM driven
13 Light sensor.   not looked into this yet.  assume analog signal
14 LE - Shift out register to load the data
15 CLK - Shift out register clock
16 NC
17 LED ENABLE.  Enable led power.  can be PWM driven to control brightness
18 CLK For programming?  Connected to SMD pads on the back along with DAT/VCC/GND
19 DAT For programming?  Connected to SMD pads on the back along with CLK/VCC/GND
20 BUZZER.   appears to be PWM controlled.  Not tried yet

Power
-------

J1  DC Jack
R1/R2 - connected to CPU Pin 1.  Assuming for detecting when power connected
D33 - Reverse polarity prevention?  (although R1/R2 before?)


terminals.  battery connection for 2 AA.
D139 - Battery -> VCC  (to stop power in J1 trying to charge batteries.
D138 - from D33 ->  VCC
